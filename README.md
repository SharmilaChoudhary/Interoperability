# üèó SpruceDAO

#This project is Scaffolded using ScaffoldETH2

SpruceDao lets users create  Dao/DataDaos with an entry barrier of their SpruceId credentials (github/twitter/email). After setting up the requirements while creating the DAO, the users who wish to join the dao first needs to verify using their credentials using spruceId. Once verified they can join the DAO and make proposals, vote the current proposals and even lend/borrow money from fellow DAO users using Union Finance

Flow
While users is creating a DAO, he/she can choose the entry restrictions which could be verification of the user joining the DAO using his credentials obtained through SpruceID. 
Once the user signs the message to join the DAO (using SIWE) their credentials are fetched from SpruceID.
Once it fulfills the DAO conditions users are allowed to join the DAO. 
After joining the DAO, users can make and submit proposals, vote on proposals and the users will now be eligible to borrow/lend tokens  from other fellow users using Union Finance.
Users can also see the whole list of other joined users, their ENS names and ENS avatars
